# Crystal Collector

## Overview

Crystal Collector is a number guessing game using images / crystals to guess the number.  It uses JQuery for DOM manipulation and Javascript for the game logic.  The objective of the game is to guess a random number between 19-120 displayed at the start of the game.  The game displays 4 crystals that are used to guess that number.  Each crystal is assigned a random number between 1-12.  When the user clicks a crystal, the number assigned to that crystal is added to the total guess for the user.  The user continues to click one of the crystals to try and guess the target number.  The game ends when the user guesses the number exacly or goes over.  If they guess exactly they win, if they go over, they lose.

* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
* I also keep track of the number of games played and wins and losses.

## Bugs and known issues

* Need to clean up design / view (may not do so I can work on star wars)
* ASK INSTRUCTORs - Why does the main (game.js) program have to be at end of body of html page vs in <head> tag
